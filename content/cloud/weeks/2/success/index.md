# What success looks like for this module

Docker is a complex tool, with several facets. For this reason, there is a core, easier set of goals, and a set of stretch goals that can help you dive deeper **if you completed the core assignments and are not behind on previous weeks**.

By end of this module, you should be able to:

## General Understanding

- [] Explain in a few words what is Docker and why it is used.
- [] Explain the difference between Dockerfiles, Docker Images, Docker Containers, and how they relate to each other.
- [] Have a high level understanding of some of the advantages and disadvantages of using Docker for development.

## Practical Skills

- [] Be able to Dockerise a Node application, and have it running locally successfully, including persistency if required.
- [] Be able to deploy a Docker application to a EC2 VM both manually and via a Github pipeline.

## Completed Work

The status of your project at the end of the week should look like this:

- [] A Backend component in EC2, Dockerised and deployed via GitHub pipelines
- [] A Frontend component in S3, Deployed via GitHub pipelines.
- [] A Database component in DNS.
