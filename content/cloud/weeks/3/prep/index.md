## Setup Docker

The next step involve Containerisation. Docker is considered the standard in this field, and having a working install on your local computer will be required for this week.

### Install Docker on your computer

This is a requirement. The official website has decent documentation on how to do so. It will push "Docker Desktop" if you're on a Mac, and "Docker CLI" on Linux. Both are ok for us, we need the underlying program and CLI.

### Go over the Docker 101 tutorial

https://www.docker.com/101-tutorial/ is a interesting tutorial from the official website to get yourself familiar with Docker. Go through it (note that the whole tutorial runs on a Docker container locally)
