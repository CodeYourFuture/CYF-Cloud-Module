## Day Plan

If you are running a session during the time before the official start of the course, you can use this day plan to help you structure your session.

**Important**: your aim throughout this time is to guide the trainee to the answer. **Do not** do the work for them.

### Help Sessions

During the week, you may want to run help sessions to help trainees who are struggling with the coursework.

General advice is to

- **Run with a small number of trainees** (we recommend between 4 and 6) so that you can give each trainee the attention they need.
- If you feel you are getting bogged down in the details, **aim to direct trainees to resources** where they can learn independently
- **Try to cover breadth of topics rather than depth**. If a trainee is struggling with a particular topic, try to give them enough information to get them unstuck, but don't try to teach them everything about that topic.
