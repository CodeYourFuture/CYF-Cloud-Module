This week we are creating a small infrastructure that will serve as bootstrap for the oncoming  challenges.

It combines 4 services: a frontend, 3 APIs and one database. You'll have to code these using your favourite programming language but do not spend more than a few hours doing so!
This is not a programming exercise. If you struggle with any of the coding, just print something static, ask for help and move on.

The database can be anything you like: Mongo, Postgres, MySQL or even something more simple.

In summary, you'll have to expose a frontend and main API to the internet while keeping the remaining components hidden from the public. We don't mind the technology you use as long as the API Cities, API Adjectives and Database remain private (that is, should be impossible to access those directly from the internet!).
At the end of the week, we'll want to see a similar diagram but with details on the technologies used and decisions taken. We also want to see a well written README.md so that anyone not familiar with the infrastructure can easily pick it up and carry on working.

## Notes

No need for fancy frontend! Just a blank page with the sentence is enough
Use any cloud system you like
You can put everything in the same virtual machine or you can separate them
You can also use containers (search for Docker and ask volunteers for help)
@cloud-volunteers are expecting questions from you. Please fire them!

## Bonus points

Associate a DNS record to the frontend  (example: silly-cloud-exercise.anydomainyouwantthatischeaporfree.com )
Use HTTPS
