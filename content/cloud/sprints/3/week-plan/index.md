## Main Objectives

- Understand what DNS is and implement
- Implement HTTPS

## Prerequisites

- Have at least one (1) running service on your Cloud Provider. This can be the frontend page that you built and deployed this week
- If you managed to deploy the whole system, that's great. If you haven't, don't worry - even a simple "hello world" page on the frontend service (with no links to APIs or Databases) will work.

## Goal

We have 2 goals - a mid-point one and an advanced one. Aim for the midpoint before going for the advanced.

### Midpoint Goal

So far your website is accessible through a raw IP quartet. We now want to:

- Make your website reachable on a URL you own (for example: CYF is available at 192.185.4.50, but you usually access via codeyourfuture.com).
- Learn about DNS and how it works. Be ready to give a quick explanation to the group next Saturday. Feel free to draw diagrams!

If you struggle to find a **free*- domain for you to register, get in touch with the mentors.

### Advanced Goal

Once done, please:

- Make your website available and reachable on port 80 - you will likely use a reverse proxy for this.
- What is a reverse proxy? What are some use cases for them? What is a Load Balancer instead?

## Final note

This week's goal is smaller than the previous two, but important: we will depend on this week's work for next week's challenge. **Please prioritise completing this week's assignment over further experiments with last week's one.** (See the prerequisite section).
