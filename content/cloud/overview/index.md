## Overview

This module is designed to introduce the concepts of cloud computing and how it can be used to support the development of software. By the end of this module a Trainee should be able to:

- Explain the benefits of cloud computing
- Explain the different types of cloud computing
- Deploy a simple application to the cloud
- Automate the deployment of an application to the cloud
- Dockerise an application and deploy it to the cloud
- Use Infrastructure-as-Code to setup and manage cloud resources

### Module Delivery

This module has been written with the following delivery in mind:

- **No Lectures**: All sessions should be discussion based, with Trainees leading the discussion through questioning working through problems they are facing.
- **Trainee Led**: Trainees should be encouraged to work through the content in their own time, with sessions being used to discuss any issues they are facing.
