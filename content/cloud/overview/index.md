This module is designed to introduce the concepts of cloud computing and how it can be used to support the development of software. By the end of this module a Trainee should be able to:

- Explain the benefits of cloud computing
- Explain the different types of cloud computing
- Deploy a simple application to the cloud
- Automate the deployment of an application to the cloud
- Dockerise an application and deploy it to the cloud
- Use Infrastructure-as-Code to setup and manage cloud resources

### Module Delivery

This module is meant to be run from Wednesday to Wednesday during the week where:

- Wednesday: Trainees start the coursework for that week
- (Optional) Thursday/Friday: Help sessions are run to help trainees who are struggling with the coursework
- Saturday: Class time is used for group discussions and Q+A.
- Sunday to Wednesday: Trainees finish coursework for the week with help from Volunteers

This module has been written with the following delivery in mind:

- **Guide, don't do**: Volunteers should aim to guide the Trainee to the answer through questioning, rather than doing the work for them.
- **No Lectures**: All sessions should be discussion based, with Trainees leading the discussion through questioning working through problems they are facing.
- **Trainee Led**: Trainees should be expected to work through the content in their own time, with sessions being used to discuss any issues they are facing.

### Asking for Help

For Trainees; If you are doing this for the first time, **this will be hard**. You **must** reach out to Volunteers to help you. Your ability to ask for help is be actively assessed during this time.

You are not expected to be able to complete this module without the help of volunteers.

### Entry Criteria

To be able to start this module **a Trainee must have independently completed all of the steps in the entry criteria page** of this website.

A Trainee will have been expected to have received help from Volunteers to be able to do this. This could include

- Help with setting up their AWS account
- Debugging help
- Discussions to help understand concepts.

However - importantly - a Trainee should have completed all of the steps themselves.
