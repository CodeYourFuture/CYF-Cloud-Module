## Learning Objectives

- Design and build systems that are resilient and secure
- Explain how everything fits together as infrastructure

## Module Content

The Cloud Module will be a 5-weeks course aimed for CYF graduates who has already completed the Full Stack Software Development Course. In short, the 5 weeks will look like this:

- Week 0 - Module entry challenge and forming study groups.
- Week 1: Intro to Cloud - Servers, Storage, Databases, and CDN (maybe Intro as a prep and the rest as week1)
- Week 2: CI/CD Using GitHub Actions
- Week 3: Docker and Containers (maybe intro to k8s, I may need help with that)
- Week 4: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Week 5: Scalability, Monitoring, and Best Practices

## Entry Challenge Test

The challenge test is to have CYF Hotel project (Frontend, Backend and database) fully deployed to Render or Netlify.

## Setup AWS Account

Before starting this course, it's essential to prepare by setting up some tools and services that we'll be using throughout the course. Follow these steps:

1. **Sign Up for AWS**: If you don't already have an AWS account, go to [AWS Home](https://aws.amazon.com/) and click on "Create an AWS Account."

2. **Complete Signup**: Follow the on-screen instructions. You'll need to provide a credit card for verification, but most of the services we'll be using fall under the AWS Free Tier.

## Implement MFA Authentication

1. **Login to AWS Console**: After your account is set up, log in to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).

2. **Navigate to IAM**: In the AWS Console, find and click on "Services," then select "IAM" under Security, Identity, & Compliance.

3. **Set Up MFA**: In IAM, navigate to the "Dashboard," then click on "Activate MFA on your root account" and follow the instructions to set up Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

## Setup Budget Alerts

1. **Navigate to AWS Budgets**: From the AWS Console, find and click on "Services," then select "Budgets" under Management & Governance.

2. **Create Budget**: Follow the prompts to create a budget, defining the cost or usage thresholds you want to track.

3. **Set Alerts**: While setting up the budget, you will have the option to configure alerts based on your budget thresholds. This way, you'll receive notifications if your spending or usage crosses the specified limits.

By completing these preparation steps, you're laying a good foundation for the course. You're ensuring that you can work within a secure and monitored cloud environment.
